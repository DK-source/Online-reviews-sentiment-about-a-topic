      "\n",
      "This is a pretty neat game. I'm having fun with it, and can't wait to see more.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a bit easier than a lot of other roguelites I've played. This should be obvious by me having only 3 hours in the game so far. But I believe this is because the current three biomes aren't supposed to be the entire game, seeing as it's an early access title. Devs have already given a name for the upcoming fourth biome, and I get the feeling that's not the end of it, either. In terms of difficulty - to draw comparison to a popular game so the most people can get an idea - I'd put this game's third biome at around the level of Hades' second biome.\n",
      "\n",
      "It also feels rather incomplete at the moment. The hub area doesn't have a lot of interesting things going on. There's two major NPCs to speak with, each presenting their own primary function to support you, as well as two weapons. The devs have stated that a third weapon is coming soon, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the difficulty ramp is reasonable as it stands and the gameplay is rather solid for a brand new early access title. The price isn't too shabby for what's on offer. Most people will be probably be looking forward to at least 10+ hours for their first full clear, unless they get super lucky with their build. But if you're a hardcore roguelite fan like me, curb your expectations a bit; this will probably be a quick romp for you and not too tough at all.\n",

      "First of all the game is an early access title and it shows. For a roguelite there's a decent amount of content but at the same time it feels like there isn't enough variety. I hope they can fix that with updates. If that is something that bothers you then you'd probably want to wait until the full release of the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the actual game itself is a visual treat. The pixel art is honestly amazing and the animations feel perfect. It makes the gameplay look great and combat feel snappy. I'm not the greatest when it comes to these sorts of action games but with Ember Knights I had no problem timing my attacks and dodging with okay timing. Each run you get to pick between a sword or a bow. Both feel great to use. There's a nice bit of building variety but your chances to make a build synergize on a run seem kinda low. Even then after the first 2 hours or so of playing I was able to hit the third map (last one?) fairly consistently (about 10 minutes per map) but every time I got there the miniboss of the place slaughtered me. In a way the game got a bit too easy but then I'd hit a wall with that boss because in particular he had one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ability that I was too slow to dodge that dealt 20 damage when you usually have about 60 max health and limited ability to heal mid boss. That's where the lack of variety started getting to me. Doing the same two maps to get to the third got somewhat stale.\n",

      "This is a very excellent game. I hate to make comparisons to other games, because this game is definitely it's own thing deserving of recognition, but for you folks who like comparisons, it reminds me of castle crashers mixed with hades, and pretty much the elements i enjoyed most from both. I definitely recommend this, its still very fun to play solo and the variety of abilities and upgrades keeps me coming back to try new things each run, I cant wait to see where this game gets to in the future.\n",

      "\n",
      "It is a bit easier than a lot of other roguelites I've played. This should be obvious by me having only 3 hours in the game so far. But I believe this is because the current three biomes aren't supposed to be the entire game, seeing as it's an early access title. Devs have already given a name for the upcoming fourth biome, and I get the feeling that's not the end of it, either. In terms of difficulty - to draw comparison to a popular game so the most people can get an idea - I'd put this game's third biome at around the level of Hades' second biome.\n",
      "\n",
      "It also feels rather incomplete at the moment. The hub area doesn't have a lot of interesting things going on. There's two major NPCs to speak with, each presenting their own primary function to support you, as well as two weapons. The devs have stated that a third weapon is coming soon, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the difficulty ramp is reasonable as it stands and the gameplay is rather solid for a brand new early access title. The price isn't too shabby for what's on offer. Most people will be probably be looking forward to at least 10+ hours for their first full clear, unless they get super lucky with their build. But if you're a hardcore roguelite fan like me, curb your expectations a bit; this will probably be a quick romp for you and not too tough at all.\n",

      "First of all the game is an early access title and it shows. For a roguelite there's a decent amount of content but at the same time it feels like there isn't enough variety. I hope they can fix that with updates. If that is something that bothers you then you'd probably want to wait until the full release of the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the actual game itself is a visual treat. The pixel art is honestly amazing and the animations feel perfect. It makes the gameplay look great and combat feel snappy. I'm not the greatest when it comes to these sorts of action games but with Ember Knights I had no problem timing my attacks and dodging with okay timing. Each run you get to pick between a sword or a bow. Both feel great to use. There's a nice bit of building variety but your chances to make a build synergize on a run seem kinda low. Even then after the first 2 hours or so of playing I was able to hit the third map (last one?) fairly consistently (about 10 minutes per map) but every time I got there the miniboss of the place slaughtered me. In a way the game got a bit too easy but then I'd hit a wall with that boss because in particular he had one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ability that I was too slow to dodge that dealt 20 damage when you usually have about 60 max health and limited ability to heal mid boss. That's where the lack of variety started getting to me. Doing the same two maps to get to the third got somewhat stale.\n",

      "This is a pretty neat game. I'm having fun with it, and can't wait to see more.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a bit easier than a lot of other roguelites I've played. This should be obvious by me having only 3 hours in the game so far. But I believe this is because the current three biomes aren't supposed to be the entire game, seeing as it's an early access title. Devs have already given a name for the upcoming fourth biome, and I get the feeling that's not the end of it, either. In terms of difficulty - to draw comparison to a popular game so the most people can get an idea - I'd put this game's third biome at around the level of Hades' second biome.\n",

      "It also feels rather incomplete at the moment. The hub area doesn't have a lot of interesting things going on.

      "\n",
      "But the difficulty ramp is reasonable as it stands and the gameplay is rather solid for a brand new early access title. The price isn't too shabby for what's on offer. Most people will be probably be looking forward to at least 10+ hours for their first full clear, unless they get super lucky with their build. But if you're a hardcore roguelite fan like me, curb your expectations a bit; this will probably be a quick romp for you and not too tough at all.\n",

      "First of all the game is an early access title and it shows. For a roguelite there's a decent amount of content but at the same time it feels like there isn't enough variety. I hope they can fix that with updates. If that is something that bothers you then you'd probably want to wait until the full release of the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the actual game itself is a visual treat. The pixel art is honestly amazing and the animations feel perfect. It makes the gameplay look great and combat feel snappy. I'm not the greatest when it comes to these sorts of action games but with Ember Knights I had no problem timing my attacks and dodging with okay timing. Each run you get to pick between a sword or a bow. Both feel great to use. There's a nice bit of building variety but your chances to make a build synergize on a run seem kinda low. Even then after the first 2 hours or so of playing I was able to hit the third map (last one?) fairly consistently (about 10 minutes per map) but every time I got there the miniboss of the place slaughtered me. In a way the game got a bit too easy but then I'd hit a wall with that boss because in particular he had one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ability that I was too slow to dodge that dealt 20 damage when you usually have about 60 max health and limited ability to heal mid boss. That's where the lack of variety started getting to me. Doing the same two maps to get to the third got somewhat stale.\n",

      "After about 6 hours of gameply I noticed a few bugs but that is expected of an early access release. Overall, the game feels like somebody took Castle Crashers and put a rogue-lite twist on it - which plays really well. The boss fights feel very well designed, and the mechanics are easy to pick up. More content in the game would be nice (as well as achievements, personal preference), but that would likely come with time as I understand that the game is still very early in release.\n",

      "\n",
      "This is a pretty neat game. I'm having fun with it, and can't wait to see more.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a bit easier than a lot of other roguelites I've played. This should be obvious by me having only 3 hours in the game so far. But I believe this is because the current three biomes aren't supposed to be the entire game, seeing as it's an early access title. Devs have already given a name for the upcoming fourth biome, and I get the feeling that's not the end of it, either. In terms of difficulty - to draw comparison to a popular game so the most people can get an idea - I'd put this game's third biome at around the level of Hades' second biome.\n",
      "\n",
      "It also feels rather incomplete at the moment. The hub area doesn't have a lot of interesting things going on. There's two major NPCs to speak with, each presenting their own primary function to support you, as well as two weapons. The devs have stated that a third weapon is coming soon, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the difficulty ramp is reasonable as it stands and the gameplay is rather solid for a brand new early access title. The price isn't too shabby for what's on offer. Most people will be probably be looking forward to at least 10+ hours for their first full clear, unless they get super lucky with their build. But if you're a hardcore roguelite fan like me, curb your expectations a bit; this will probably be a quick romp for you and not too tough at all.\n",

      "First of all the game is an early access title and it shows. For a roguelite there's a decent amount of content but at the same time it feels like there isn't enough variety. I hope they can fix that with updates. If that is something that bothers you then you'd probably want to wait until the full release of the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the actual game itself is a visual treat. The pixel art is honestly amazing and the animations feel perfect. It makes the gameplay look great and combat feel snappy. I'm not the greatest when it comes to these sorts of action games but with Ember Knights I had no problem timing my attacks and dodging with okay timing. Each run you get to pick between a sword or a bow. Both feel great to use. There's a nice bit of building variety but your chances to make a build synergize on a run seem kinda low. Even then after the first 2 hours or so of playing I was able to hit the third map (last one?) fairly consistently (about 10 minutes per map) but every time I got there the miniboss of the place slaughtered me. In a way the game got a bit too easy but then I'd hit a wall with that boss because in particular he had one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ability that I was too slow to dodge that dealt 20 damage when you usually have about 60 max health and limited ability to heal mid boss. That's where the lack of variety started getting to me. Doing the same two maps to get to the third got somewhat stale.\n",

I hate to make comparisons to other games, because this game is definitely it's own thing deserving of recognition, but for you folks who like comparisons, it reminds me of castle crashers mixed with hades, and pretty much the elements i enjoyed most from both. I definitely recommend this, its still very fun to play solo and the variety of abilities and upgrades keeps me coming back to try new things each run, I cant wait to see where this game gets to in the future.\n",

Devs have already given a name for the upcoming fourth biome, and I get the feeling that's not the end of it, either.

Each run you get to pick between a sword or a bow. Both feel great to use. There's a nice bit of building variety but your chances to make a build synergize on a run seem kinda low. Even then after the first 2 hours or so of playing I was able to hit the third map (last one?) fairly consistently (about 10 minutes per map) but every time I got there the miniboss of the place slaughtered me. In a way the game got a bit too easy but then I'd hit a wall with that boss because in particular he had one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ability that I was too slow to dodge that dealt 20 damage when you usually have about 60 max health and limited ability to heal mid boss. That's where the lack of variety started getting to me. Doing the same two maps to get to the third got somewhat stale.\n",

      "After about 6 hours of gameply I noticed a few bugs but that is expected of an early access release. Overall, the game feels like somebody took Castle Crashers and put a rogue-lite twist on it - which plays really well. The boss fights feel very well designed, and the mechanics are easy to pick up. More content in the game would be nice (as well as achievements, personal preference), but that would likely come with time as I understand that the game is still very early in release.\n",

The graphics are really awesome, and the systems seem like they are well put together, I enjoyed the part were I had to actively attack the enemy so some of my powers would recharge instead of just running around.\n",

Overall, the game feels like somebody took Castle Crashers and put a rogue-lite twist on it - which plays really well. The boss fights feel very well designed, and the mechanics are easy to pick up. More content in the game would be nice (as well as achievements, personal preference), but that would likely come with time as I understand that the game is still very early in release.\n",

      "\n",
      "It is a bit easier than a lot of other roguelites I've played. This should be obvious by me having only 3 hours in the game so far. But I believe this is because the current three biomes aren't supposed to be the entire game, seeing as it's an early access title. Devs have already given a name for the upcoming fourth biome, and I get the feeling that's not the end of it, either. In terms of difficulty - to draw comparison to a popular game so the most people can get an idea - I'd put this game's third biome at around the level of Hades' second biome.\n",

Most people will be probably be looking forward to at least 10+ hours for their first full clear, unless they get super lucky with their build. But if you're a hardcore roguelite fan like me, curb your expectations a bit; this will probably be a quick romp for you and not too tough at all.\n",

I hope they can fix that with updates. If that is something that bothers you then you'd probably want to wait until the full release of the game.\n",

      "Now, the actual game itself is a visual treat. The pixel art is honestly amazing and the animations feel perfect. It makes the gameplay look great and combat feel snappy. I'm not the greatest when it comes to these sorts of action games but with Ember Knights I had no problem timing my attacks and dodging with okay timing. Each run you get to pick between a sword or a bow. Both feel great to use. There's a nice bit of building variety but your chances to make a build synergize on a run seem kinda low. Even then after the first 2 hours or so of playing I was able to hit the third map (last one?) fairly consistently (about 10 minutes per map) but every time I got there the miniboss of the place slaughtered me. In a way the game got a bit too easy but then I'd hit a wall with that boss because in particular he had one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ability that I was too slow to dodge that dealt 20 damage when you usually have about 60 max health and limited ability to heal mid boss. That's where the lack of variety started getting to me. Doing the same two maps to get to the third got somewhat stale.\n",

It is a face pace rouge like game but it is not that punishing if you are behind, which for someone like me is awesome since I do enjoy games like this and rogue legacy, but some of them are just a little to tough with the timing. The graphics are really awesome, and the systems seem like they are well put together, I enjoyed the part were I had to actively attack the enemy so some of my powers would recharge instead of just running around.\n",

Overall, the game feels like somebody took Castle Crashers and put a rogue-lite twist on it - which plays really well. The boss fights feel very well designed, and the mechanics are easy to pick up. More content in the game would be nice (as well as achievements, personal preference), but that would likely come with time as I understand that the game is still very early in release.\n",

      "\n",
      "It is a bit easier than a lot of other roguelites I've played. This should be obvious by me having only 3 hours in the game so far. But I believe this is because the current three biomes aren't supposed to be the entire game, seeing as it's an early access title. Devs have already given a name for the upcoming fourth biome, and I get the feeling that's not the end of it, either. In terms of difficulty - to draw comparison to a popular game so the most people can get an idea - I'd put this game's third biome at around the level of Hades' second biome.\n",

      "It also feels rather incomplete at the moment. The hub area doesn't have a lot of interesting things going on.

Most people will be probably be looking forward to at least 10+ hours for their first full clear, unless they get super lucky with their build. But if you're a hardcore roguelite fan like me, curb your expectations a bit; this will probably be a quick romp for you and not too tough at all.\n",

I hope they can fix that with updates. If that is something that bothers you then you'd probably want to wait until the full release of the game.\n",

      "Now, the actual game itself is a visual treat. The pixel art is honestly amazing and the animations feel perfect. It makes the gameplay look great and combat feel snappy. I'm not the greatest when it comes to these sorts of action games but with Ember Knights I had no problem timing my attacks and dodging with okay timing. Each run you get to pick between a sword or a bow. Both feel great to use. There's a nice bit of building variety but your chances to make a build synergize on a run seem kinda low. Even then after the first 2 hours or so of playing I was able to hit the third map (last one?) fairly consistently (about 10 minutes per map) but every time I got there the miniboss of the place slaughtered me. In a way the game got a bit too easy but then I'd hit a wall with that boss because in particular he had one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ability that I was too slow to dodge that dealt 20 damage when you usually have about 60 max health and limited ability to heal mid boss. That's where the lack of variety started getting to me. Doing the same two maps to get to the third got somewhat stale.\n",

The graphics are really awesome, and the systems seem like they are well put together, I enjoyed the part were I had to actively attack the enemy so some of my powers would recharge instead of just running around.\n",

Overall, the game feels like somebody took Castle Crashers and put a rogue-lite twist on it - which plays really well. The boss fights feel very well designed, and the mechanics are easy to pick up. More content in the game would be nice (as well as achievements, personal preference), but that would likely come with time as I understand that the game is still very early in release.\n",

      "This is a pretty neat game. I'm having fun with it, and can't wait to see more.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a bit easier than a lot of other roguelites I've played. This should be obvious by me having only 3 hours in the game so far. But I believe this is because the current three biomes aren't supposed to be the entire game, seeing as it's an early access title. Devs have already given a name for the upcoming fourth biome, and I get the feeling that's not the end of it, either. In terms of difficulty - to draw comparison to a popular game so the most people can get an idea - I'd put this game's third biome at around the level of Hades' second biome.\n",

      "It also feels rather incomplete at the moment. The hub area doesn't have a lot of interesting things going on. There's two major NPCs to speak with, each presenting their own primary function to support you, as well as two weapons. The devs have stated that a third weapon is coming soon, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the difficulty ramp is reasonable as it stands and the gameplay is rather solid for a brand new early access title. The price isn't too shabby for what's on offer. Most people will be probably be looking forward to at least 10+ hours for their first full clear, unless they get super lucky with their build. But if you're a hardcore roguelite fan like me, curb your expectations a bit; this will probably be a quick romp for you and not too tough at all.\n",

I hope they can fix that with updates. If that is something that bothers you then you'd probably want to wait until the full release of the game.\n",

      "Now, the actual game itself is a visual treat. The pixel art is honestly amazing and the animations feel perfect. It makes the gameplay look great and combat feel snappy. I'm not the greatest when it comes to these sorts of action games but with Ember Knights I had no problem timing my attacks and dodging with okay timing. Each run you get to pick between a sword or a bow. Both feel great to use. There's a nice bit of building variety but your chances to make a build synergize on a run seem kinda low. Even then after the first 2 hours or so of playing I was able to hit the third map (last one?) fairly consistently (about 10 minutes per map) but every time I got there the miniboss of the place slaughtered me. In a way the game got a bit too easy but then I'd hit a wall with that boss because in particular he had one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ability that I was too slow to dodge that dealt 20 damage when you usually have about 60 max health and limited ability to heal mid boss. That's where the lack of variety started getting to me. Doing the same two maps to get to the third got somewhat stale.\n",

      "Ember Knights is a game that came out on 20Apr2022, it is a pretty fun hack and slash, it is out on early access so lets take a look at it https://store.steampowered.com/app/1135230/Ember_Knights/\n",

      "Ember Knights is out, and it does not disappoint! It is a face pace rouge like game but it is not that punishing if you are behind, which for someone like me is awesome since I do enjoy games like this and rogue legacy, but some of them are just a little to tough with the timing. The graphics are really awesome, and the systems seem like they are well put together, I enjoyed the part were I had to actively attack the enemy so some of my powers would recharge instead of just running around.\n",

      "There are a few cons of course, the game at the moment is a little short, and it is in early access. However I think all of this can be overcome if the dev stays on top of the game!\n",

      "The game play loop is quite fun and all of the enemies and allies look amazing.\n",

      "Suggestions for Developers:\n",
      "1. Make Arlan's patch match so it stays on the same eye between his avatar in the store and the big version next to the dialog.\n",
      "2. Make it easier to revive your friends. Possibilities include sacrificing some of your own life to save them, high-five to split life equally between two players (like Toejam & Earl), certain store items that revive them, reviving on mini-boss fights etc.\n",
      "3. Maybe each colored ember knight could have a name and a special ability or unique weapon sort of like the old Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle games.\n",

      "After about 6 hours of gameply I noticed a few bugs but that is expected of an early access release. Overall, the game feels like somebody took Castle Crashers and put a rogue-lite twist on it - which plays really well. The boss fights feel very well designed, and the mechanics are easy to pick up. More content in the game would be nice (as well as achievements, personal preference), but that would likely come with time as I understand that the game is still very early in release.\n",

      "At the time of this review the game just came out early access.\n",
      "For any Rogue like or lite fan it is a good game to play, however, the game seems to lack a bit of personality gameplay-wise. The mechanics are almost directly ripped from titles like Hades and Dead Cells. The art style is cute and playing with friends is a joy.\n",

      "Early access issues:\n",
      "While playing with 2 friends there have been multiple instances of players having the game freeze, crash, or disconnect them from the lobby. This isn't a big deal since Ember Knights just came out and I expect some bad bugs at this time.\n",

      "\n",
      "This is a pretty neat game. I'm having fun with it, and can't wait to see more.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a bit easier than a lot of other roguelites I've played. This should be obvious by me having only 3 hours in the game so far. But I believe this is because the current three biomes aren't supposed to be the entire game, seeing as it's an early access title. Devs have already given a name for the upcoming fourth biome, and I get the feeling that's not the end of it, either. In terms of difficulty - to draw comparison to a popular game so the most people can get an idea - I'd put this game's third biome at around the level of Hades' second biome.\n",
      "\n",
      "It also feels rather incomplete at the moment. The hub area doesn't have a lot of interesting things going on. There's two major NPCs to speak with, each presenting their own primary function to support you, as well as two weapons. The devs have stated that a third weapon is coming soon, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the difficulty ramp is reasonable as it stands and the gameplay is rather solid for a brand new early access title. The price isn't too shabby for what's on offer. Most people will be probably be looking forward to at least 10+ hours for their first full clear, unless they get super lucky with their build. But if you're a hardcore roguelite fan like me, curb your expectations a bit; this will probably be a quick romp for you and not too tough at all.\n",

      "First of all the game is an early access title and it shows. For a roguelite there's a decent amount of content but at the same time it feels like there isn't enough variety. I hope they can fix that with updates. If that is something that bothers you then you'd probably want to wait until the full release of the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the actual game itself is a visual treat. The pixel art is honestly amazing and the animations feel perfect. It makes the gameplay look great and combat feel snappy. I'm not the greatest when it comes to these sorts of action games but with Ember Knights I had no problem timing my attacks and dodging with okay timing. Each run you get to pick between a sword or a bow. Both feel great to use. There's a nice bit of building variety but your chances to make a build synergize on a run seem kinda low. Even then after the first 2 hours or so of playing I was able to hit the third map (last one?) fairly consistently (about 10 minutes per map) but every time I got there the miniboss of the place slaughtered me. In a way the game got a bit too easy but then I'd hit a wall with that boss because in particular he had one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ability that I was too slow to dodge that dealt 20 damage when you usually have about 60 max health and limited ability to heal mid boss. That's where the lack of variety started getting to me. Doing the same two maps to get to the third got somewhat stale.\n",

      "This is a very excellent game. I hate to make comparisons to other games, because this game is definitely it's own thing deserving of recognition, but for you folks who like comparisons, it reminds me of castle crashers mixed with hades, and pretty much the elements i enjoyed most from both. I definitely recommend this, its still very fun to play solo and the variety of abilities and upgrades keeps me coming back to try new things each run, I cant wait to see where this game gets to in the future.\n",

      "After about 6 hours of gameply I noticed a few bugs but that is expected of an early access release. Overall, the game feels like somebody took Castle Crashers and put a rogue-lite twist on it - which plays really well. The boss fights feel very well designed, and the mechanics are easy to pick up. More content in the game would be nice (as well as achievements, personal preference), but that would likely come with time as I understand that the game is still very early in release.\n",

      "\n",
      "This is a pretty neat game. I'm having fun with it, and can't wait to see more.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a bit easier than a lot of other roguelites I've played. This should be obvious by me having only 3 hours in the game so far. But I believe this is because the current three biomes aren't supposed to be the entire game, seeing as it's an early access title. Devs have already given a name for the upcoming fourth biome, and I get the feeling that's not the end of it, either. In terms of difficulty - to draw comparison to a popular game so the most people can get an idea - I'd put this game's third biome at around the level of Hades' second biome.\n",
      "\n",
      "It also feels rather incomplete at the moment. The hub area doesn't have a lot of interesting things going on. There's two major NPCs to speak with, each presenting their own primary function to support you, as well as two weapons. The devs have stated that a third weapon is coming soon, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the difficulty ramp is reasonable as it stands and the gameplay is rather solid for a brand new early access title. The price isn't too shabby for what's on offer. Most people will be probably be looking forward to at least 10+ hours for their first full clear, unless they get super lucky with their build. But if you're a hardcore roguelite fan like me, curb your expectations a bit; this will probably be a quick romp for you and not too tough at all.\n",

      "First of all the game is an early access title and it shows. For a roguelite there's a decent amount of content but at the same time it feels like there isn't enough variety. I hope they can fix that with updates. If that is something that bothers you then you'd probably want to wait until the full release of the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the actual game itself is a visual treat. The pixel art is honestly amazing and the animations feel perfect. It makes the gameplay look great and combat feel snappy. I'm not the greatest when it comes to these sorts of action games but with Ember Knights I had no problem timing my attacks and dodging with okay timing. Each run you get to pick between a sword or a bow. Both feel great to use. There's a nice bit of building variety but your chances to make a build synergize on a run seem kinda low. Even then after the first 2 hours or so of playing I was able to hit the third map (last one?) fairly consistently (about 10 minutes per map) but every time I got there the miniboss of the place slaughtered me. In a way the game got a bit too easy but then I'd hit a wall with that boss because in particular he had one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ability that I was too slow to dodge that dealt 20 damage when you usually have about 60 max health and limited ability to heal mid boss. That's where the lack of variety started getting to me. Doing the same two maps to get to the third got somewhat stale.\n",

I hate to make comparisons to other games, because this game is definitely it's own thing deserving of recognition, but for you folks who like comparisons, it reminds me of castle crashers mixed with hades, and pretty much the elements i enjoyed most from both. I definitely recommend this, its still very fun to play solo and the variety of abilities and upgrades keeps me coming back to try new things each run, I cant wait to see where this game gets to in the future.\n",

      "It has a absolutely wonderful art style and is an exceptional local co-op game to play with your friends.\n",
      "The game play loop is quite fun and all of the enemies and allies look amazing.\n",

      "Suggestions for Developers:\n",
      "1. Make Arlan's patch match so it stays on the same eye between his avatar in the store and the big version next to the dialog.\n",
      "2. Make it easier to revive your friends. Possibilities include sacrificing some of your own life to save them, high-five to split life equally between two players (like Toejam & Earl), certain store items that revive them, reviving on mini-boss fights etc.\n",
      "3. Maybe each colored ember knight could have a name and a special ability or unique weapon sort of like the old Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle games.\n"
